    <h1>Vector Databases Overview</h1>
<p>I was having a look around at vector databases to have a play with document search and realised that suddenly there's support all over the place for them, even from the big players.</p>
<p>ELI5: geo databases query 2 dimensional data, vector DBs query data with 1000+ dimensions. That means data can be related in many ways, such as word meaning.</p>
<p>A few months back it seemed like it was just tiny startups and unstable alphas if you wanted vector DBs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search">MongoDB Atlas last month</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/enterprise-search/generative-ai">Elastic 2 months ago</a></li>
<li>pgvector has been around for a while but 2 months ago <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/05/amazon-rds-postgresql-pgvector-ml-model-integration/">AWS added it to RDS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I had a play with <a href="https://www.trychroma.com/">Chroma</a> - it's very quick to get started with if you want to hack around with a vector DB and see what's possible now.</p>

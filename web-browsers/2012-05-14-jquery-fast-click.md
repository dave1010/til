# New jQuery plugin for mobile browsers: jQuery Fast Click

date:   2012-05-14 12:24:07

Mobile browsers delay browser clicks (or, more accurately, taps) by 300ms so they can detect double taps. This can be great but if you want to speed up clicks in your mobile site or app, you can use my plugin: [jQuery Fast Click](http://dave1010.github.com/jquery-fast-click/).

The [code is on GitHub](https://github.com/dave1010/jquery-fast-click) and it’s under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. It’s tested on Android and iOS but if you have any issues on jQuery Fast Click, please use [GitHub’s issues](https://github.com/dave1010/jquery-fast-click/issues).

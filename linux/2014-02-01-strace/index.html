    <p>Strace</p>
<p>date:   2014-02-01 12:24:07</p>
<p>Quick strace command that I use all the time to see what files a process is opening:</p>
<p>strace -f <command> 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep ^open</p>
<p>Really useful to see what config files something is reading (and the order) or to see what PHP (or similar) files are being included.</p>
<p>There’s normally other ways to do this (eg using a debugger) but sending strace’s stderr to stdout and piping through grep is useful in so many cases it’s become a command I use every day or 2.</p>

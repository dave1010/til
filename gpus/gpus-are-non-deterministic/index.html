    <h1>GPUs are non-deterministic</h1>
<p>This means they can do the same calculation twice and get different answers.</p>
<p>Be careful if you use GPUs for security related things.</p>
<p>This is because of how floating point arithmetic works in CPUs/GPUs - the same thing that results in <code>0.1 + 0.2</code> not being equal to <code>0.3</code>.</p>
<p>Essentially it's non-associative. That means that <code>(a + b) + c</code> is not necessarily equal to <code>a + (b + c)</code>.</p>
<p>So because GPUs are incredibly parallel, they could do a+b+c in 2 different ways.</p>

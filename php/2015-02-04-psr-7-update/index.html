            <h1>HTTP messaging PSR-7 update</h1>
<p>date:   2015-02-04 08:14:07</p>
<p>This is a quick update to my <a href="http://createopen.com/design/php/2014/12/15/psr-7.html">original blog post criticizing mutability in PSR-7</a>.</p>
<p>The original blog post got a fair few tweets and traction on Reddit. More importantly, <a href="https://twitter.com/mwop">Matthew Weier O'Phinney</a>, the lead author of PSR-7, read it and took time to <a href="http://createopen.com/design/php/2014/12/15/psr-7.html#comment-1788691985">respond</a> with valid feedback on mutability vs immutability.</p>
<p>Before I got the chance to respond to Matthew, he <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/php-fig/9gK8vX8iYZ8/5PZ9rx8UvXYJ">posted</a> on the PHP-FIG mailing list mentioning that he'd tried implementing an immutable version of the PSR in <a href="https://github.com/weierophinney/http/tree/feature/immutability">phly/http</a> and it worked really well!</p>
<p>Immutability is (almost) always the best way to design interfaces. I'm please I (and others like <a href="https://twitter.com/everzet">@everzet</a> on Twitter) managed to nudge the PSR in that direction.</p>
<p>The current version of the <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md">draft PSR-7 spec</a> is now immutable at it looks like the final version will be too.</p>
<p>Finally, huge thanks to Matthew for not only responding to my feedback but also giving immutability a shot and even defending it on the PHP-FIG mailing list!</p>

<p>Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions in PHP</p>
<p>date:   2012-07-30 08:14:07</p>
<h3>In JavaScript</h3>
<p>A common patten in JavaScript is <a href="http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/">immediately-invoked function expressions</a>, also known as self-executing anonymous functions. These allow you to create a private scope that won’t pollute the global namespace. They look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
(function () {
    // variables defined here are 
    // only visible in this scope
}());
</code></pre>
<h3>In PHP</h3>
<p>Since PHP 5.3 brought along anonymous functions, the same can be done in PHP. Albeit with a slightly less elegant syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
call_user_func(function() {
    // do something
});
</code></pre>
<p>This is useful in PHP if you have some code that has side effects but you don’t want to litter variables.
Real world examples</p>
<p>When bootstrapping a framework or CMS, you often have to setup the environment by defining some constants. With IIFEs you’re free to use variables liberally so you’re code’s easier to understand.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
call_user_func(function() {
    // do some work, creating $result
    define('SOMETHING', $result)
});
</code></pre>
<p>You can even return a variable from the function and assign it to a variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
$var = call_user_func(function() {
	$a = 2;
	$b = 2;
	return $a + $b;
});
</code></pre>
<p>Another use is registering namespaces with autoloaders (if you’re not using composer yet):</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
call_user_func(function() {
    require_once './vendor/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/ClassLoader/UniversalClassLoader.php';
    $loader = new Symfony\Component\ClassLoader\UniversalClassLoader();
    $loader-&gt;registerNamespace('Acme', __DIR__.'/vendor/acme/src');
});
</code></pre>
<h3>The future?</h3>
<p>PHP 5.5 looks like it has lots of <a href="http://nikic.github.com/2012/07/10/What-PHP-5-5-might-look-like.html">interesting features</a>. Hopefully one them will be better function dereferencing. If it is, we can expect to have a syntax like the following, without the ugly call to call_user_func:</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php
// php 5.5?
function() {
    // do something
}();
</code></pre>
<p>It’s great to see PHP improving and gradually making functions first-class citizens. Perhaps one day we’ll be able to pass functions around in PHP as easily as as we can in languages like JavaScript.</p>

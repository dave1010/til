            <h1>The Unimaginable Sizes of Graham's Number and Other Large Numbers</h1>
<p>I was talking to my kids about large numbers like a googol (10^100) and a googolplex. I knew bits and pieces about bigger number but not enough to confidently explain it until now.</p>
<h1>Addition, multiplication, iteration and tetration</h1>
<p>First, let's see how operations are just repeats of the previous operation.</p>
<ul>
<li>multiplication: 3×3 is just releated addition, 3+3+3 = 9</li>
<li>exponention: 3^3 is just repeated multiplication, 3×3×3 = 27</li>
<li>tetration: 3↑↑3 is just repeated exponention, 3^3^3 = about 8 billion</li>
</ul>
<h2>Writing a Googolplex</h2>
<p>A googolplex is an enormous number defined as 10^10^100. That's a 1 followed by a googol (10^100) zeros! It's impossible to write down in normal notation due to its sheer size.</p>
<h2>Beyond Exponential Notation</h2>
<p>There are numbers so big that they can't be expressed using exponential notation. These require other methods, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation">Knuth's up-arrow notation</a>, which allows us to describe numbers that are exponentially bigger than a googolplex.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3↑↑3</strong> (3 double arrow 3) signifies a number where 3 is raised to the power of itself, repeated 27 times (since 3^3 = 27). Three to the power of three to the power of three to the power of three... (27 times). This results in 7,625,597,484,987 - about 8 billion.</li>
<li><strong>3↑↑↑3</strong> (3 triple arrow 3) takes this concept to the next level by stacking a power tower of 3's that is 7,625,597,484,987 layers high. This is far more than a googolplex and is virtually incomprehensible in size. It would take about 30,000 years to say &quot;three to the power of...&quot; 8 billion times (trust me on this). Compare this to a googolplex, where you can say &quot;ten to the power of ten to the power of a hundred&quot; in 3 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>3↑↑↑↑3</strong> (3 quadruple arrow 3) increases complexity further. Instead of just 8 billion 3's stacked in a power tower, there's so many 3s that it would take 30,000 years to just say how many 3's there are! If each atom in our universe could represent &quot;3 to the power of,&quot; there still wouldn't be enough to describe how big the number is.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see how ↑ notation can quickly lead to large numbers, even with just 4 of them.</p>
<h2>Graham's Number</h2>
<p>Then there's Graham's number, perhaps the most famous of very very large numbers. Here's how it builds:</p>
<p>We start off with 3↑↑↑↑3. Remember that this number takes 30,000 years to describe the the height of the power tower: the power tower isn't just billions or googols tall, it's more than the number of atoms in the universe tall.</p>
<p>We call this g₁.</p>
<p>The next level is g₂. This is 3, with g₁ up arrows then a other 3. You saw how quickly the numbers grew when we went from 2, to 3, to 4 up arrows. Now we're at an impossibility large number of up arrows.</p>
<p>This process continues, where we take a number that we can't even describe with up arrows, then use that many up arrows between two 3's.</p>
<p>We keep doing this 64 times to get Graham's number.</p>
